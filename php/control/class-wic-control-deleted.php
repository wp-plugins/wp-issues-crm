* supports fields of type deleted, which should be configured in dictionary with transient = true (1) 
*		-- it is possible that other form fields may later be needed as transient (i.e., not saved in database),
* 				also possible that the term is redundant and there are never any other transient fields, but 
*				have given it a separate term for stability of the code (transient fields are bypassed in several places)
*		-- every repeating group should be configured with a deleted type field with field_slug = screen_deleted
*				( if it is desired to be able to delete rows from the form )
*		-- the screen_deleted field should be assigned to a group within the entity which will determine its positioning
*				( it can have any field_label, x is just one idea, and can be styled further in css  
*					class = wic-input-deleted-label )
